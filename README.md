# Deep-Fake-Detection
Deepfake detection refers to the process of identifying and detecting manipulated or synthetic media, such as images, videos, or audio recordings, that have been generated using deep learning techniques. Deepfakes are created using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep neural networks, and can be used to manipulate or superimpose someone's face onto another person's body or to create entirely fabricated content that appears realistic.
Detecting deepfakes can be challenging because they are designed to deceive human perception and mimic real media. However, researchers and developers have been working on various techniques to identify deepfakes. Here are some common approaches used in deepfake detection:
Facial and body movements analysis: Deepfake detection methods often focus on inconsistencies in facial expressions, eye movements, lip-syncing, and other visual cues that may appear unnatural or mismatched in manipulated videos.
Deep learning models: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be trained to classify real and fake media. These models learn from large datasets of both real and synthetic media, enabling them to distinguish between genuine and manipulated content.
